   /**
   * #### Description
   * The `__generateId` method generates a unique identifier string. This ID is used internally
   * to uniquely identify instances or components within the `PokerRoom` class, helping manage
   * each room separately by its own ID.
   *
   * #### Implements
   * N/A
   *
   * #### Overrides
   * N/A
   *
   * #### Purpose
   * The purpose of the `__generateId` method is to provide a consistent, automatic way
   * to generate unique IDs, ensuring that each `PokerRoom` instance has its own distinct
   * identifier. This prevents conflicts or confusion between instances.
   *
   * #### Events
   * N/A
   *
   * #### Parameters
   * This method does not take any parameters.
   *
   * #### Requirements
   * - Utilizes the `generateUniqueId` function from an external library or internal utility.
   * - This function must be capable of producing unique, non-repeating strings each time it's called.
   *
   * #### Returns
   * The method returns a `string` type, representing a unique identifier.
   *
   * #### Usage
   * Typically used internally within the `PokerRoom` or `Casino` classes when a new
   * room instance is created, this method is called automatically without requiring
   * external intervention.
   *
   * @returns {string} - A unique string identifier generated by the `generateUniqueId` function.
   *
   * @throws {Error} - This method does not throw any errors.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * class PokerRoom {
   *   private __id: string = this.__generateId();
   * 
   *   private __generateId(): string {
   *     return generateUniqueId(); // Creates a new unique ID for this PokerRoom instance
   *   }
   * }
   *
   * const room = new PokerRoom();
   * console.log(room.__id); // Outputs a unique identifier, e.g., "room_12345abc"
   * ```

  /**
   * #### Description
   * Retrieves the current queue of players awaiting seating in the `PokerRoom`.

   * #### Implements
   * `N/A` - This method is part of `PokerRoomInterface` without implementing external methods.
   *
   * #### Overrides
   * `N/A` - This method does not override any superclass or parent methods.
   *
   * #### Purpose
   * The `getQueue` method is essential for accessing the list of players waiting for a seat in the `PokerRoom`.
   * It provides insight into the queue length and composition, helping manage room capacity and player flow.
   *
   * #### Events
   * `N/A` - This method does not emit any events.
   *
   * #### Parameters
   * `N/A` - No parameters are required for this method.
   *
   * #### Requirements
   * `N/A` - This method simply returns the existing queue without modifying it.
   *
   * #### Returns
   * - Returns an array of `PokerPlayerInterface` instances, representing the players in the waiting queue.
   *
   * #### Usage
   * Call this method to view the list of players awaiting entry to the room. This can be used for monitoring,
   * player assignment, and room management purposes.
   *
   * @returns {PokerPlayerInterface[]} - An array containing the players in the waiting queue.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const pokerRoom = new PokerRoom({ name: "Lobby", tableSize: 6 });
   * console.log(pokerRoom.getQueue()); // Logs an array of players awaiting seating
   * ```

   * #### Implements
   * `N/A` - This method is part of the `PokerRoomInterface` and does not implement any external methods.
   *
   * #### Overrides
   * `N/A` - This method does not override any superclass or parent methods.
   *
   * #### Purpose
   * The `setQueue` method provides a structured way to set or update the player queue. This queue is essential
   * for room management, helping to keep a record of players awaiting entry and manage seating arrangements.
   *
   * #### Events
   * `N/A` - No events are emitted by this method.
   *
   * #### Parameters
   * - `queue`: An array of `PokerPlayerInterface` objects, each representing a player awaiting entry into the room’s `PokerTable`.
   *
   * #### Requirements
   * - `queue` should be an array of valid `PokerPlayerInterface` instances.
   * - If empty, the queue indicates that no players are currently waiting for entry.
   *
   * #### Returns
   * - Returns the `queue` array after updating it within the room.
   *
   * #### Usage
   * Use this method to set or update the player queue in cases where player flow needs control,
   * ensuring smooth transitions as players are seated at the table.
   *
   * @param {PokerPlayerInterface[]} queue - The new list of players waiting to enter the table.
   * @returns {PokerPlayerInterface[]} - Returns the updated player queue.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const pokerRoom = new PokerRoom({ name: "Room2", tableSize: 6 });
   * const queue = [new PokerPlayer("Alice"), new PokerPlayer("Bob")];
   * pokerRoom.setQueue(queue); // Sets the player queue
