/**
 * @interface `PokerRoomConfig`
 *
 * Represents the configuration settings necessary to create a `PokerRoom` within the Casino system.
 * This interface defines core properties such as a unique identifier (`id`), room name (`name`),
 * and an array of table configurations (`tableConfigs`) that standardize room setup and ensure consistent
 * properties across all `PokerRoom` instances.
 *
 * #### Purpose
 * The `PokerRoomConfig` interface serves as a blueprint for initializing `PokerRoom` instances.
 * By defining required properties upfront, this configuration helps streamline room creation,
 * reduce errors, and maintain uniformity across room instances within the Casino system.
 *
 * #### Structure Overview
 * The interface includes:
 * - **Room Identification**: `id` and `name` properties for unique identification and naming of the room.
 * - **Table Configurations**: An array, `tableConfigs`, that holds one or more configurations detailing each table's settings within the room.
 *
 * #### Usage
 * Primarily used as an input for the `PokerRoom` constructor, `PokerRoomConfig` allows developers
 * to define each room’s essential properties during instantiation. This structure helps prevent
 * setup errors and ensures consistency among multiple rooms in the Casino.
 *
 * #### Requirements
 * - **`tableConfigs`**: Must be a valid array containing one or more `PokerTableConfig` objects.
 * - **`id` and `name` (optional)**: Enhance room uniqueness and readability, if provided.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const roomConfig: PokerRoomConfig = {
 *   id: "room42",
 *   name: "High Stakes",
 *   tableConfigs: [
 *     { tableSize: 6, smallBlind: 50, bigBlind: 100 },
 *     { tableSize: 8, smallBlind: 100, bigBlind: 200 }
 *   ]
 * };
 * const pokerRoom = new PokerRoom(roomConfig); // Initializes a new PokerRoom with the specified configuration
 * ```

  /**
   * @property {string | undefined} id
   *
   * A unique identifier for the poker room, allowing for easy reference and management within the Casino system.

   * #### Purpose
   * Used to uniquely identify each `PokerRoom` within the Casino, providing a direct reference for room-specific operations.
   *
   * #### Requirements
   * - **Optional**: If provided, `id` must be a unique, non-empty string to avoid conflicts.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const roomConfig: PokerRoomConfig = {
   *   id: "room1",
   *   name: "High Rollers",
   *   tableConfigs: [{ tableSize: 6, smallBlind: 10, bigBlind: 20 }]

  /**
   * @property {string | undefined} name

   * #### Purpose
   * Serves as a user-friendly label for the poker room, assisting administrators and players in identifying the room easily.
   *
   * #### Requirements
   * - **Optional**: `name` should be a non-empty string if defined, providing a clear label for the room.
   *
   * @example

   *
   * #### Purpose
   * Defines the structure and game settings for each table in the room, supporting multiple table configurations
   * under one `PokerRoom` instance.
   *
   * #### Requirements
   * - **Required**: `tableConfigs` must contain one or more `PokerTableConfig` objects to provide valid game settings.

/**
 * @interface `PokerRoomInterface`
 *
 * Defines the responsibilities and structure for managing a `PokerRoom` within the Casino system. This interface is
 * essential for implementing operations such as room setup, player queue management, and table configuration, thereby
 * organizing and facilitating smooth poker game management.
 *
 * #### Purpose
 * The `PokerRoomInterface` serves as a standardized blueprint for any `PokerRoom` class, detailing essential methods
 * for room configuration, player management, and table access. By following this structure, the system ensures that each
 * poker room is identifiable, manageable, and consistent in functionality.
 *
 * #### Extends
 * This interface extends `NodeJS.EventEmitter` to allow event-driven management of room actions like table updates,
 * player entry, or exit events, enhancing flexibility in asynchronous operations across the Casino system.
 *
 * #### Methods Overview
 * The `PokerRoomInterface` includes the following methods:
 * - **setName**: Sets or updates the room’s name.
 * - **setTables**: Configures the tables in the room, setting attributes such as table size and blinds.
 *
 * #### Events Overview
 * The `PokerRoomInterface` includes the following events:
 * - **roomUpdated**: Emitted whenever the room’s settings are updated, such as when tables are reconfigured.
 *
 * #### Usage
 * This interface is designed to standardize the management of `PokerRoom` instances, offering a complete structure for
 * both client-facing interactions (like displaying room details) and internal operations (like seating players or adjusting
 * tables).
 *
 * @extends NodeJS.EventEmitter
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const pokerRoom: PokerRoomInterface = new PokerRoom();
 * pokerRoom.on('roomUpdated', () => console.log(`Room updated with new settings`));
 * pokerRoom.setName("HighRollers");
 * console.log(pokerRoom.getName()); // Logs "HighRollers"
 * ```
